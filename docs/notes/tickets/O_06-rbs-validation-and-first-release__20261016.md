# O_06-rbs-validation-and-first-release__20261016 — Open

- Scope: Validate and release the first fully usable open RBS calculator.
- Status: open
- Opened: 2026-10-16
- Updated: 2026-10-16
- Current State: Planned; implementation has not started. See the work and acceptance criteria below.
- Verification: Repository setup checked ticket H1/fields, queue membership and local links on 2026-10-16; implementation validation is specified below and has not run.
- Cleanup: Owning session records final checks and unresolved findings, resolves the ticket, distills reusable guidance into docs/validation/, updates both indexes and linked GitHub issue, then removes the resolved ticket.
- GitHub Issue: https://github.com/rohinshanker/regulatory-site-prediction-reconstruction/issues/6
- Priority: P0
- Owner: Unclaimed; the implementing session must claim this ticket before writing its scope.
- Dependencies: 02–04; RBS evidence from 05 for hosted agreement claims.

Deliver the first installable, documented RBS prediction release. This is the milestone before implementation of the other calculators; source discovery for those tools may continue independently.

## Work

- Use ticket 12 for the relevant benchmark-quality audit and frozen experimental splits. Keep any ticket-13 improved profile distinct from the compatibility profile; assess both against the same held-out data.

- Assemble licensed experimental/reference datasets with exact sequences, host, construct context, measured quantity, conditions and model settings. Split by study/sequence family to prevent near-duplicate leakage.
- Evaluate equation correctness, hosted agreement and experimental predictive accuracy separately under the shared contract. Report site matching/coverage, per-term energy differences, log-rate errors, ranks, failures and uncertainty by domain.
- Predeclare acceptance tolerances and numerical regression criteria before held-out evaluation. Compare against the historical baseline, simple appropriate baselines and Jaymin's scorer where executable.
- Package a stable library/CLI, single/batch prediction, JSON/CSV and verified annotated export, examples, supported input limits, dependency pins and full source/parameter notices.
- Publish model identity, known deviations and applicability. Native cyanobacterial accuracy is not established by an E. coli fit or a host dropdown. The UTEX synthetic-RBS reporter paper has narrower scope than genome-wide calibration.

## Acceptance criteria

- A clean machine installs the release and runs complete offline examples with no account, private DNAc, required restrictive dependency or unavailable binary.
- All specified prediction paths and exports pass unit/integration/coordinate tests; every added branch is exercised. Runtime/memory limits and batch failure behavior are measured.
- Reproducible benchmark reports distinguish implementation correctness, production-reference agreement and biological accuracy, with complete denominators and unresolved gaps.
- Hosted testing can be pending for a clearly labeled provisional release, but claims of production equivalence and completion of the hosted-comparison work remain open until measured. Never fabricate reference fixtures.
- The release/tag, compatibility notes and consumer-ready schema are available; ticket 10 can integrate this first calculator independently of the others.

## Verification to record

Full CI/coverage, fresh-install and offline smoke tests, frozen benchmark rerun, licence/dependency inventory and an independent review of the exact release candidate. RBS design is completed under ticket 11 and must not be advertised before it works.
